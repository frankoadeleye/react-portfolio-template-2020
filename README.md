## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites üìã

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead/or of NPM ‚òùÔ∏è

```

```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

## Acknowledgments üéÅ

I was motivated to create this react version out of sheer desire to switch from the reciever mentality to a giver/provider mentality, but even those that give recieves, right? We'll all forever be on both sides.
Also thanks to [Brad](https://github.com/bradtraversy) for the original version [modern portfolio](https://github.com/bradtraversy/modern_portfolio) and [Jacobo Martinez](https://github.com/cobidev) for a wonderful way to structure a ReadMe file.
